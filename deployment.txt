What to consider before deploying: 

1). A good knowledge and previous experience of working with Vercel and especially Django. 

2). No need of setting up any cloud Database. 

3). No need of setting up superuser in production. 

4). Make sure the Google Maps are served well in production. 

5). Make sure all the media files are served well in the production environment. 

6). Make sure to install all the dependencies from "requirements.txt" file inside the project folder.

That's all
